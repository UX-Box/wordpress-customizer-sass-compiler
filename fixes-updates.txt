Plugin Updates

1.  Include paths to theme BS SASS and CSS files
2.  Add more default BS variables
3.  Ensure there are slashes included in the custom sass file path
4.  Check to make sure custom sass file exists, and is writable
5.  When you remove a variable, we need to recompile the Sass back to it's default value BEFORE removing from the database
	a.  When you turn off custom variables, also need to revert back to defaults
	b.  Same for BS.
6.  Create different sanitize functions with a foreach loop so we don't have to write an "if" statement for each one
7.  Create a "color picker" option for the custom variables


Future Enhancements

1.  Add JS fallback
2.  Ajax error handling
